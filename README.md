# chronicel
Our super sweet hacker management system for HackTCNJ 2017!

chronicel is a simple and minimal registration system made for HackTCNJ. It provides both hackers and organizers everything they need all in one place. HackTCNJ is a smaller, more personal hackathon, so we have no need for hacker applications, team registration, or reimbursement.

**It also has a really nice system for organizers to work with MyMLH, this is what we would really love for others to build upon!**
